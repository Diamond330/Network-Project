str	hello world !!!
str	no pain, no gain
str	Network secruity is a interesting topic
str	CS6501 is a great class
str	The encoded message can then be encrypted with RSA.
str	Extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean algorithm
str	I haven't heard of the result of such a process being used in cryptography though; usually it's the modulus of said power that matters. If it's the same in your case then you can just use the 3-argument form of pow() instead.
str	You shouldn't try to calculate x^y directly for huge values of y - as has already been pointed out, this is pretty difficult to do (takes lots of space and processing power). You need to look at algorithms that solve the problem for you with fewer multiplication operations. Take a look at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring for starters.
str	The OAEP algorithm is a form of Feistel network which uses a pair of random oracles G and H to process the plaintext prior to asymmetric encryption. When combined with any secure trapdoor one-way permutation {\displaystyle f}f, this processing is proved in the random oracle model to result in a combined scheme which is semantically secure under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA). When implemented with certain trapdoor permutations (e.g., RSA), OAEP is also proved secure against chosen ciphertext attack. OAEP can be used to build an all-or-nothing transform.
str	An adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (abbreviated as CCA2) is an interactive form of chosen-ciphertext attack in which an attacker first sends a number of ciphertexts to be decrypted chosen adaptively, then uses the results to distinguish a target ciphertext without consulting the oracle on the challenge ciphertext, in an adaptive attack the attacker is further allowed adaptive queries to be asked after the target is revealed (but the target query is disallowed)
